## üéØ Technical Highlights

### Velocity-Aware PID Control
```python
# Traditional PID
output = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * derivative

# Enhanced with velocity feedback
output = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * derivative - kv * velocity_error
```

### A* Pathfinding Integration
- Automatic obstacle grid generation
- Real-time path replanning
- Smooth waypoint following with PID control

### Emergency Braking System
- Active force application opposing current motion
- Separate angular and linear braking coefficients
- Immediate response for safety-critical situations

## üîß Customization

### Tuning PID Parameters
```python
# In src/controllers.py - adjust for different behaviors
position_controller = VelocityAwarePIDController(
    kp=1.2,   # Aggressiveness of approach
    ki=0.05,  # Long-term error correction
    kd=0.3,   # Smoothing and prediction
    kv=0.7    # Velocity damping (prevents overshoot)
)
```

### Adjusting Robot Physics
```python
# In src/robot.py - modify friction and dynamics
friction_coefficient = 0.2           # Linear friction
angular_friction_coefficient = 1.5   # Angular friction (higher for stability)
```
